# Changelog

Notable changes to readability will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project attempts to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

For the purposes of Semantic Versioning, the readability output object for a given
input document is not considered a stable API. That is, minor version increments
may change this output. Patch version increments will only do so in ways that are
strict improvements (e.g. from empty strings or exceptions to something more
reasonable).
